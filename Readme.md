Observations and Insights
1. Capomulin and Ramicane both had a greater effect on final tumor volume than Infubinol and Ceftamin, and the data for them was less dispersed, which means there was more variability. Only Infubinol had an outlier with drastic tumor reduction, however this does not indicate drug efficacy. Both Capomulin and Ceftamin are negatively skewed while Infubinal and Ramicane are symmetrical in their data distribution.  

2. For Capomulin it seems drug efficacy is dependent on building up to a certain dosage, such that at day 20 the tumor volume decreased drastically over the next 4 to 5 days. Then, a second phase of tumor reduction occurs thereafter. From this individual mouse it looks like the effects of Capomulin are quite rapid once it reaches the necessary dose in the body. 

3. Tumor volume is positively correlated with mouse weight. So, as the mouse grows, so does the tumor. The slope of the regression (0.95, close to 1) shows that tumor volume is proportional to to body weight. Finally, above 18g of body weight, the volume of the tumors appears to increase more drastically (i.e., at 17g there were a few smaller tumors and some larger ones).
